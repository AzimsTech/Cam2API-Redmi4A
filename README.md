Starting with the MIUI 10 update, Xiaomi decided to remove camera2 api files in system. As such, Redmi 4A/5A users which uses MIUI will not able to enable camera 2 API support. MIUI 10 lacks lib file which is require for camera2 api functionality to work.

I just found and picked up the necessary file for Camera2API to work from MIUI10. Thanks to the guy @ 4pda forum

    system\lib\hw\camera.msm8937.so
  
This module also adds camera2api support in the build.prop systemlessly, so you don't have to. This is done by editing build.prop to add or enable "persist.camera.HAL3.enabled=1". 

# Trobleshooting
1. Install Camera2 Probe from playstore to check if it working. Level 3 means it is working.

2. If your GCam of choices doesn't work, please use another one from [https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/](https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/). For Redmi 4A, I recomend installing [GCam-5.1.018-Pixel2Mod-Arnova8G2-V8.3b1.apk](https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/dev-arnova8G2/).
